As opposed to the 'conventional' method of using the Jacobi method on a generated matrix and source vector (there is no 'source' for this task), the provided code combines the effects of the inverted matrix directly to the source vector to directly generate the solution vector. There are 3 key 'for' loops within the Jacobi function that can be run parallel. The 'for' loops used to generate the 'active' interior points are run concurrently before using them to generate the values along both boundaries simultaneously. The boundary values only depend on the interior point and do not depend on each other (as they are generated on opposite ends of the mesh)so they can be generated simultaneously. 

The summation aspect of both the norm functions can also be run parallel using the 'reduction' option to sum faster. The 2-norm function can also take advantage of SIMD vectorization, whilst the infinite-norm cannot, as the latter depends on maximum values that may change based on what the values are within the vector.
